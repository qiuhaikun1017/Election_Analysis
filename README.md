# Election Analysis 

## Overview of Project

In this essay, we would like to help Tom, an election employee, to analyze a large set of election result data and determine the winning candidate for this election. Further more, we want to use this code script as an analysis model so that Tom could use this model to analyze similar dataset for future elections.

Before we started our analysis, we will first give a brief introduction about the dataset we are given. In this raw data sheet, a total of 369711 row of votes was presented. In each row, we are given information for its vote ballot ID, voted candidate name and its county name. There are three county names and three candidiate names are included in this sheet.

## Election-Audit Results
By using our model, we created the following election result graph. According to the below graph, we have some of the key points for this election results.
